# Tech-Blog

## Description

For this assignment, we had to build a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other posts as well. It will follow the MVC paradigm and will use Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM and the express-session npm package for authentication.
